I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the [https://www.ucas.ac.cn/ University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)], advised by [https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~tdguo Prof. Tiande Guo] and [https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~hancy Prof. Congying Han].

Currently, I am a visiting Ph.D. Student at the [https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/ University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)], advised by [https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/ Prof. Nan Jiang]. 

Before beginning my graduate studies, I earned my B.S. in Mathematics from the [https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)].


== Research Interests

My research focuses on /trustworthy reinforcement learning/ across theory, algorithms, and applications.
I am dedicated to developing theoretically grounded algorithms that can effectively guide practical scenarios, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical guarantees and empirical performance.

Broadly, I am also interested in the interplay between /machine learning/ and /optimization/, with a particular focus on policy optimization, machine learning for combinatorial optimization (ML4CO), training of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs).
